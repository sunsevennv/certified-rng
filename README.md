# GamblingTec RNG

## About
This is a simple wrapper using Laminas/Laminas/Rand which has been certified by Sunseven NV for use with
a UK, Malta and Curacao Gambling License.

The wrapper is freely available for use by the gambling community for their games. By using this wrapper, we can assist you
with RNG certification which is a pre-requisite of a gambling license.

When certifying software, we must submit test utilities to the test lab which they then use to generate large quantities
of data. The lab then tests the data for randomness by running multiple tests against the data. This is a time consuming
process often taking multiple hours to complete each test. For this reason, obtaining RNG certification can take a 
number of weeks to obtain.

The advantages of using this wrapper is that we have already written the test utilities needed by the lab who have our data
on file. For this reason, we can obtain certification much quicker if you use our library.

### Test Utility (command line)

For a demonstration of the GamblingTec RNG, please see: https://github.com/sunsevennv/gamblingtec-rng which is a 
command line utility using the wrapper.
